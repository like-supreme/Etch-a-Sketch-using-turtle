# 🎨 Etch A Sketch with Python Turtle

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Etch A Sketch** toy using the `turtle` module.  
You can control the turtle (pen) using your keyboard to draw lines and reset the screen — just like the original toy!

---

## 🚀 Features

- Use **WASD keys** to move the turtle and draw lines:
  - `W`: Move forward
  - `S`: Move backward
  - `A`: Turn counter-clockwise (left)
  - `D`: Turn clockwise (right)
- Press `C` to clear the screen and reset the turtle's position to the center
- Turtle draws in real-time as you move
- Fun and interactive way to explore turtle graphics

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3 or higher
- Built-in `turtle` module (comes with Python by default)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The `turtle` module creates a screen and a turtle object.
- Keyboard listeners are set up using `screen.onkey()`.
- Each key press triggers a function to move or reset the turtle.
- The turtle draws while moving, creating line patterns like a sketch pad.

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run the Python file:
python etch_a_sketch.py
Use W, A, S, D keys to draw

Press C to clear the screen

Close the window or click to exit

The turtle draws lines in real-time based on your key inputs.
The movement mimics the nostalgic Etch A Sketch toy experience — use WASD to sketch, press C to clear!
my drawing is bad ngl :D
